<h1>Hello, world!</h1>

This is my very first website created for a friends company.

I am a Military Intelligence veteran currently in the Information Technology field working for higher education.  I have a degree in Information Systems Security with a focus on Cybersecurity.  Even though I have a degree, most of my accomplishments are because I am self-taught.  I strive everyday to be better than my best, and I believe the best way to learn is to teach yourself- you are your best teacher. 

I have taken a great interest in web design.  I find it fascinating, and above all FUN.  It is something I thoroughly enjoy doing as I am looking to create projects such as these in my free time.  I am a beginner in both my career and in my hobby of learning full-stack web development but I am excited to see how I grow in my journey.

Feel free to leave constructive critism.

Cheers,
Kristianna
